The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code works as expected in most browsers, but some older browsers might not render the `width: 50%;` correctly if the parent element doesn't have a defined width. The floating element might not take up the expected 50% of the parent.
