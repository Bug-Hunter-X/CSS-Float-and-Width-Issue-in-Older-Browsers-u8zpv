To solve the problem, ensure the parent element has a defined width. For example:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%; /* Or a fixed width like 800px */
}
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

Alternatively, consider using Flexbox or Grid for more reliable and modern layout management.  Flexbox is often preferred for simpler layouts:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
div {
  width: 50%;
}
```
This eliminates the need for floating and provides a cleaner, more predictable solution.
